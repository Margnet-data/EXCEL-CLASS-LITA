In my LITA Excel classes, I explored various Excel functions, pivot tables, and report dashboard creation to enhance my data analysis skills. Below is a breakdown of each topic and its application.

## Excel Functions

Excel functions allow for efficient data manipulation and analysis. During this course, I covered:
- **Basic Functions**: SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN
- **Logical Functions**: IF, AND, OR
- **Lookup Functions**: VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH
- **Text Functions**: CONCATENATE, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, TRIM, LOWER, UPPER
- **Date Functions**: TODAY, NOW, YEAR, MONTH, DAY, DATEDIF


Each function has a unique application, making it easier to work with large datasets and extract meaningful insights.

## Pivot Tables

Pivot tables enable quick summarization and analysis of large datasets by grouping, filtering, and reorganizing data. Key areas of focus included:
- **Creating Pivot Tables**: Building pivot tables from raw data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Grouping and Filtering Data**: Using pivot table tools to drill down into specific data segments.
- **Calculated Fields and Items**: Adding custom calculations within the pivot table to enhance analysis.
- **Slicers and Timelines**: Adding interactivity to pivot tables for user-friendly data exploration.

## Report Dashboards

Learning how to create Excel dashboards provided insights into visualizing data effectively for stakeholders. Topics covered included:
- **Dashboard Layout and Design**: Structuring reports for clarity and impact.
- **Data Visualization**: Using charts, graphs, and conditional formatting to highlight key data points.
- **Dynamic Dashboards**: Integrating pivot tables and slicers to make dashboards interactive.
- **KPI Tracking**: Setting up key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor performance over time.
